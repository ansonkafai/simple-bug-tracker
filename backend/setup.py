#
# notes:
# - first step:
#   The first step in this code is to import setuptools.
#   Then you read in your README.md file into a variable that you will use soon.
#   The last bit is the bulk of the code.
#   Here you call setuptools.setup(), which can take in quite a few different arguments.
#   The example below is only a sampling of what you can pass to this function.
#   To see the full listing, you'll need to go here:
#   - https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/
# - find_packages():
#   Most of the arguments are self-explanatory. Let's focus on the more obtuse ones.
#   The packages arguments is a list of packages needed for your package.
#   In this case, you use find_packages() to find the necessary packages for you automatically.
# - classifiers:
#   The classifiers argument is used for passing additional metadata to pip.
#   For example, this code tells pip that the package is Python 3 compatible.
#   Now that you have a setup.py, you are ready to create a Python wheel!
